# PHP starter project to create web applications.
This starter kit is preconfigured to facilitate fast development.

## Inspirations and reference
This kit is heavily influenced by the greate course
[PHP: Object-Oriented Programming with Databases](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/php-object-oriented-programming-with-databases)
taught by Kevin Skoglund. If you are learning about OOP, I highly recommend it
even if PHP is not your primary focus.
